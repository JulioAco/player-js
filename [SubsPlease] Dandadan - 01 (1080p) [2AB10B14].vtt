WEBVTT

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.190
Huh?

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.700
I said, if you ain't lendin' me money,
then no date today.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.620
Oh, but I'd be okay
if you finally put out instead.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.080
You'll pay for the love hotel, though.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.460
You need to be punched!

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.670
Why you little...

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.930
You're full of it!

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.390
I've had enough of you!

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.810
Yer broke and ya ain't puttin' out!
Get lost!

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.980
Gimme a break, moron!

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.650
Octopus! Squid! Tuna!

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.980
Totes funny!

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.550
EPISODE 1
THAT'S HOW LOVE STARTS, YA KNOW!

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.480
Seafood names aren't insults.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.110
Come on, comfort me!
He was my first boyfriend.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.530
That's why I told you to not go for him.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.950
What was so good about him, anyway?

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.910
He looked like Ken Takakura.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.960
- Oh, there you go.
- You're so annoying.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.790
Nothing wrong with that!
I like masculine guys like Ken Takakura!

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.380
"I am an awkward fellow, after all."

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.260
Dudes like that are extinct.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.220
<i>What the heck.</i>

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.470
<i>Will I not be able to meet
another Mr. Ken in my lifetime?</i>

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.100
Come on, someone comfort me!

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.650
Such a cruel world.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.780
- Damn it!
- You missed?

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.530
- I did miss.
- Don't look over here. Gross.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.950
- We have this, too.
- Nice.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.950
Put a magnet inside.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.620
This'll hurt, won't it?

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.000
What are you reading there?

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.670
Oh? Uh, um...

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.800
BIRTH OF THE AEROSPACE SELF-DEFENSE FORCE
GUARDING OUTER SPACE!!

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.640
How lame.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.020
Do only scum live in this world?

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.060
Man, I've had enough.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.900
Where can I relieve all this stress?

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.400
Miss Momo Ayase!

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.740
I know you're in love!

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:43.360
Huh?

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.410
I know you're in love!

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.240
How many times you gonna say that?

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.000
Someone like Miss Ayase talking to me?
That's gotta be the only reason!

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.040
Maybe you got the wrong idea?

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.550
It's not like I wanna get
chummy with you or anything.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.590
Forget all that earlier.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.550
This is what I'm talking about!

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.930
The President has already gone to Mars!
What is the entirety of Project Pegasus!?

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:05.890
Huh? What?

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.930
You're a fan of the occult!

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.140
Oh, I don't believe in UFOs or aliens
or stuff like that.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.600
I'm not talking about a UFO, but a UAP!

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.650
PO

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.150
Unidentified Aerial Phenomena!

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.650
Hey, you're being a pest.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.030
The U.S. military has officially acknowledged
the existence of UAPs and reformed the Space Force!

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.570
Japan has also newly created
an Aerospace Defense Force!

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.490
Any way you look at it,
they're getting ready for Space Wars!

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.830
Can I go now?

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:30.660
What?

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.580
No, wait! This has the newest image
of Nessie, too. Here!

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.590
It also talks about Lieutenant Colonel
Jim Channon and Skinwalker Ranch!

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.460
Shut up!

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.090
I just got dumped
so I don't want any of this.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.470
How you push stuff at me is so typical
of otaku and really annoying!

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.520
That's why you have no friends!

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.140
Don't talk to me like you know me.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.660
Sorry, that was a bit much.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.920
YOUR TRUE POWERS AND POTENTIAL
HAVE YET TO AWAKEN...

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:27.840
Here.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.680
I don't believe in aliens.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.520
But I do believe in ghosts.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.520
Oh no, there's no such thing as ghosts.

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.770
I matched the conversation topic to yours,
but you outright deny that!?

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.610
Don't you mock the occult!

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.530
Just so you know,
my grandma is a spirit medium.

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:51.240
What?

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.000
Have you ever seen exorcism?
It's really wicked!

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.170
The possessed person goes into convulsions!

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.290
You can go into convulsions from illness, too.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.090
It's not proof that ghosts are out there.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.510
Then have you ever had
an alien let you ride a UFO!?

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.220
Your logic is jumping too far!
Are you an idiot!?

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:13.680
Huh?

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:17.230
She gave up on Ken Takakura
and went after an otaku?

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:20.400
Look. It's like she doesn't care
what other people would think.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.020
Can't say I hate it.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.030
Then let's have a contest, dammit!

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.490
If there really are ghosts,
you'll be serving me as a gofer!

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.820
I'll show you UFOs, I mean, UAPs!

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.000
If you're able to see one, M-Miss Ayase,
you'll be my gofer instead!

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.830
NAGI GENERAL HOSPITAL

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:42.380
OCCULT-KUN

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.710
What is this place?
It's way too scary!

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.220
What part of this is a UFO hotspot?

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:52.340
<i>Nagi Hospital there is called
the sanctuary for UFOs!</i>

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.640
<i>If you call for a UFO on the roof,
you will experience Abduction!</i>

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.730
What's Abduction?

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:03.560
<i>That's when an alien kidnaps you
and experiments with your body.</i>

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.780
Wait, hold on! Have you been
experimented on before!?

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.650
<i>There is a chance that I have!</i>

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:09.320
Huh?

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.990
<i>Many people who experience Abduction
have their memories erased.</i>

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.620
Hey, you. You've never seen
a UFO before, have you?

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.370
<i>Do you know about regressive hypnosis?</i>

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.080
Don't change the subject on me.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.210
<i>It's not an issue
of whether or not you've seen one!</i>

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:24.080
<i>The point is whether or not
there's proper proof that it exists!</i>

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:25.340
Shut up!

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.710
Anyway, how are things on your end?

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:33.180
I have arrived.

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:41.230
KEEP OUT

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.230
At the spiritual hotspot.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.150
Now, I'll go and prove it right now...

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.780
that there are no such things as ghosts!

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.490
<i>Hey, you aren't freaking out, are you?</i>

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.830
<i>By the way, that spot is famous on the 'net
for something definitely being there.</i>

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:14.590
Too shy, shy boy, in this moment!

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:17.850
<i>They say speaking loudly
is the most dangerous thing to do.</i>

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:19.720
Too shy, shy boy...

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.680
<i>On the 'net.</i>

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.430
You've been mentioning the 'net a lot.

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:25.400
So have you seen a ghost, Miss Ayase?

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.110
<i>Nope.</i>

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:27.980
What?

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:30.690
<i>How dare you talk so authoritatively earlier!</i>

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:31.900
My bad!

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:33.780
<i>Take back that attitude
you've been giving me!</i>

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:37.200
<i>It's absurd that you've never
seen a ghost but believe in them!</i>

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.290
It's not absurd.

00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:42.660
I told you my grandma's a spirit medium.

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:46.130
I love my grandma a lot
since I don't have parents.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:49.380
So, I see.

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.420
Why are you getting all meek and stuff?

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:57.640
Get a load of this.
My family is seriously weird.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:02.060
I always had to perform
a good luck ritual before stepping outside.

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:05.640
I was always forced to do it
the entire way to school.

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:09.440
And of course,
I was the laughingstock of all the boys.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:13.860
If I don't do it, Grandma got pissed.
It was the pits.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.320
But the toughest part of it all...

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:20.450
was when the boy I liked
made fun of me.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.790
I really hated my grandma.

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:27.670
"Because of that weird ritual,
the boy I like hates me."

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:31.000
I think I said something horrible
like that to Grandma.

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:37.550
Since then, I didn't talk to Grandma until recently,
and I stopped doing the ritual.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:43.270
But you know, I get pissed when someone else
makes fun of my family.

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:46.850
That's when I realized...

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:51.110
I didn't hate the fact that
the boy I liked didn't like me.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:56.030
I hated the fact that the boy I liked
made fun of my grandma.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:02.990
In reality, I loved both Grandma and her job
as a spirit medium, because it felt special.

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:08.670
How she decided to take me in,
and lovingly raised me all by herself...

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:11.130
I have faith in my grandma.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.590
That's why I believe in ghosts.

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:18.430
So anyway, why do you believe in aliens?

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:22.970
That really doesn't matter, right?

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:25.810
What's with that?
You don't have any reasons?

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.390
Do you need a reason to like something?

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:30.190
Well, you have a point.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:34.400
More like, Occult-kun,
you sure talk bluntly over the phone.

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:38.570
I-Is that so?

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.870
Miss Ayase, you're pretty easy to talk to.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:56.260
I'll let you suckle my teats, so...

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.590
lemme gobble that weenie.

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:01.550
Ghost!

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:03.510
<i>Hold on! You shouldn't run there!</i>

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.470
<i>Hey, Occult-kun!</i>

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:08.980
No way! Impossible!
That was just an ordinary granny!

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:10.140
<i>Oc... kun... Stop right now!</i>

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.690
That's probably it. Just an ordinary granny!

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.190
<i>They say on the 'net she's bad news!</i>

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.740
I'm pretty sure I misunderstood something.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:21.200
I simply bumped into a lewd granny!

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.910
<i>They say you can't let her outrun you
at any cost!</i>

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:29.000
<i>If you lose a race against
Turbo Granny, you'll be cursed!</i>

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:34.250
OCCULT-KUN

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:35.130
OCCULT-KUN

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:37.340
Hey, Occult-kun! Are you listening?

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:39.590
Hello? Answer me!

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.300
You're kidding me, right?

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.590
I'll head over there right now!
Just hang on!

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:57.320
What are those things?
Seriously, cut it out.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.040
Hello, woman person.

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:13.790
We are Serpoians. We are called that
because we come from the planet Serpo.

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:15.000
Aliens?

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:18.800
Don't be afraid. We are a friendly people.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:22.170
Friendly guys
don't strip girls naked, you know!

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:23.260
Where are my clothes?

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.220
We have taken proper care
of your belongings.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.180
They're all tattered! Pay for damages!

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:31.480
And I wanna go home,
so can you take this off?

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:34.230
Our kind only has males.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:37.650
Thus, we reproduce
through clone technology.

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:39.570
Are you even listening?

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:43.150
However, identical units
do not instigate biological evolution.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:46.990
Conflict, as well as basic emotions,
were annihilated.

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.700
Therefore, for us to regain
reproductive function similar to humans,

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.410
we want your "bananas."

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:55.790
We will now have sex.

00:12:56.170 --> 00:13:00.550
After having sex with you, we will extract
your uterus and your banana for research.

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:01.840
Gimme a break!

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:06.180
I did date a douchebag,
but I didn't let him take my virginity!

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:09.470
My chastity has been saved
for a Ken Takakura I have yet to meet!

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:12.270
No way some creepy alien
is gonna take it from me!

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:24.150
In order to arouse your desire, we will use
psychokinesis to control your brain waves.

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:30.700
How is it? Isn't the temperature
of your body getting warmer?

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.420
What's this?
She is resisting the psychokinesis.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:40.630
What incredible spiritual power.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:41.630
However...

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.510
Let us begin.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.170
No...

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:46.510
Stop!

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:53.770
A phone call?

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:56.730
Someone sure has
a really bad sense of timing.

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:25.420
Miss Ayase! I'm sorry!

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:27.220
There was a ghost!

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:30.220
Turbo Granny has cursed me!

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:33.100
Occult-kun! I'm glad!
Can you help me?

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.220
Who are you?

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:38.640
Infiltrating using a smartphone.
Not even we have technology like that.

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:43.610
Please help! I can't control myself!

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:47.490
Lemme gobble that weenie!

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:49.030
Come on, get a grip!

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:50.780
Man person over there.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:53.200
We did not authorize your intrusion.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.580
Leave immediately, or else...

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.040
Please give us your "banana."

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:02.750
Gross!

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:03.920
Six Sense Organs!

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:08.720
So fast! I cannot set my psychokinesis.

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:13.970
Our cherished bananas!

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:15.600
You banana thief!

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.350
Serpoian Form Serpo-Grammetry!

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:20.100
Occult-kun!

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:23.020
We have never encountered
someone so aggressive.

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:28.030
We have an amiable relationship
with humans. So give us your bananas.

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:30.860
I'll give it to you! Anything if it's mine!

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:33.410
I've been wanting to see aliens
for the longest time!

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:38.000
Because I didn't have any friends,
I thought at least aliens would be my friends.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.790
I've been calling to the skies
for a UFO since grade school!

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.710
But you never came!

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:50.590
No matter how much I called for you,
you never showed up!

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:53.090
Other humans bullied me to pass their time.

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:55.550
COURAGE

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:55.550
Aliens don't give me the time of day.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:59.140
Nobody ever acknowledged my existence.

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.060
But Miss Ayase....

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:04.190
She actually stood up for me, despite that!

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:07.440
So don't you lay a finger on her!

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:11.400
I won't allow anyone to hurt her!

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:17.450
If it's for her sake,
I'll even become a monster!

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.330
Keep at it, Occult-kun!

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:21.580
Show 'em what a man you are!

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:22.460
Fie!

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:25.710
Miss Ayase...

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:26.960
It looks impossible after all.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:28.920
You gave up really fast there!

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:34.890
We cannot become friends
with a violent person like you.

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:39.680
Besides, we like woman persons
more than man persons.

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:42.890
Now, once again,
I shall arouse your desire.

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:48.270
<i>Take your chi out.</i>

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:49.690
<i>I don't wanna.</i>

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:54.150
My friends make fun of me
every single day because of that.

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:55.820
What are you talking about?

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:58.990
If you have your chi out,
you won't get hurt or sick.

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:01.080
Bad things can't get near you.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:04.750
First, firm up your lower abs.

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:09.960
Imagine having your chi shoot up
from the top of your head.

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:12.260
<i>She's doing it again!</i>

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.010
<i>Is she communicating
with aliens or something?</i>

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:18.680
I hate it! I'm never doing it again!

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.140
Momo! Hold on!

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:23.310
I hate you, Grandma!
You fake spirit medium!

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:30.110
<i>Why am I remembering the past right now?</i>

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:35.070
<i>I'm sorry, Grandma.
I just felt embarrassed back then.</i>

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:39.450
<i>Firm up your lower abs.</i>

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.580
<i>Chi shoot up from the top of your head.</i>

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:49.210
No way!

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:50.500
What?

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:53.010
Miss Ayase, you can use psychic powers?

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:55.220
Well, I'm surprised by that myself!

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:59.050
Unbelievable!
My psychokinesis is being pushed back!

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:00.510
Why?

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:06.020
Did I stimulate her brain waves too much
and cause the woman person's chakra to open up?

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.480
She was real.

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:10.230
Grandma was a real spirit medium!

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.070
Thank you, Grandma!

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:15.030
With this I can take those scumbags...

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.490
and send them flying!

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:35.590
What is this? That was a UFO?

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:37.420
Occult-kun, are you okay?

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.220
Let's get outta here!

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:48.310
Ow! What are you doing, idiot!
Regain your sanity already!

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:50.520
Damn you!

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:57.610
Turbo Granny?

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:00.240
Who the hell are you?

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:05.040
His curse hasn't lifted!

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.120
Granny is out of his body, though!

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.830
I have possession of that kid's weenie.

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:15.250
As long as I have his weenie,
that kid's curse won't be lifted.

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:18.050
If you want it back,
come to the tunnel.

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:20.300
This place is too far for me.

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:25.310
I'll take you on as much as you want
if it's in the tunnel, gaudy hag.

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:27.980
Who you calling a gaudy hag,
you old bag of crap!

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:29.350
Give him back his thingy!

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:35.190
Crap! If we don't escape,
we're gonna die!

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:38.240
Get a grip, you idiot!
We're gonna escape!

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.590
This is the worst.

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:05.050
I'll believe in aliens.
Like, I was kidnapped and all.

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:08.770
I'll believe in ghosts, too.
I got cursed after all.

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:11.310
So, what should we do from here?

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:12.730
What should we do?

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:17.020
You lose control of yourself if I don't
hold the curse back with psychic powers.

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:17.900
I'm sorry.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:21.700
I lost my uniform, my wallet,
my smartphone. Everything.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:25.160
How can I be lifted from this curse?

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:29.620
You have to beat the crap out of Turbo Granny.
She's the cause of the curse.

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:33.460
I see. Then I'll head on over there.

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:35.290
Huh? Right now?

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:39.000
Miss Ayase, please wear
my clothes back home.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.880
Hold on! You'll lose control without me!

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:50.470
All of this happened
because of what I did.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.980
I can't get you involved
in it anymore, Miss Ayase.

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:57.650
I'll use willpower to make it to the tunnel,
and then make it work somehow.

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:01.110
Why can't you ask me to come with you?

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:03.900
After that experience earlier,
I can't leave you alone!

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.910
You would've died earlier if I wasn't around!

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:12.040
Is it okay for you
to help someone like me?

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:14.370
Stuff like that is such a hassle.

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:24.430
Come on, put some clothes on.

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:27.550
Let's go!

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:29.350
I'm sorry.

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.810
I am an awkward fellow, after all.

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:35.480
Miss Ayase, please put some clothes on.

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:37.940
If you don't, I can't bring myself
to speak properly.

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:42.070
<i>No way. Why is my heart racing?</i>

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:44.150
<i>This can't be.</i>

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:48.160
<i>I was just surprised because he happened
to recite one of Ken Takakura's lines.</i>

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.910
<i>I need to calm down for now.</i>

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:55.660
By the way, what's your name?

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:58.000
I'm terrible at remembering names.

00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.960
Oh? Um...

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.420
I'm Ken Takakura.

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:10.050
DAN

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:10.300
DAN DA

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:11.970
DAN DA DAN

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.190
Aliens really did exist!

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:45.730
Ghosts exist, too!

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:48.190
The existence of aliens and ghosts
being proven means that

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:49.650
there's a possibility of supernatural
phenomena, UMA,

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:52.620
and all other things that were said to be absurd
can be proven as well.

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:52.620
Oh, fine, I get it! Ready.

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.620
EPISODE 2
THAT'S A SPACE ALIEN, AIN'T IT?

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:55.200
Next episode,
"That's a Space Alien, Ain't It?!"

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.200
Next episode,
"That's a Space Alien, Ain't It?!"

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.910
Hey, be in sync with me!
